# Tugas Akhir

Welcome to Tugas Akhir, a suspenseful horror game developed using Unity 3D.

## Overview

Tugas Akhir immerses players in a chilling experience where they must navigate through supernatural disturbances while managing their sanity. The game leverages Unity 3D to create a visually compelling environment filled with eerie encounters and strategic gameplay.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Sanity Points

Sanity points gauge the player's mental state through various indicators:

- **Heartbeat**: Audible and visual cues; a faster heartbeat indicates lower sanity.
- **Breathing**: Audible cues; heavier, irregular breathing signifies lower sanity.
- **Vision**: Screen edges become foggy/blurry as sanity decreases.

### Player Actions

Players must employ strategic actions to survive:

- **Open/Close Eyes**: Avoid direct eye contact with ghosts or disturbances to preserve sanity. Includes a cooldown period.
- **Move Camera**: Look around the room to locate threats and avoid prolonged exposure.
- **Read Prayers**: Recite prayers to ward off certain ghosts, each with unique vulnerabilities.
- **Control Breathing**: Regulate breathing to manage body temperature and remain calm under pressure.

### Disturbances and Challenges

Navigate through supernatural challenges:

- **Temperature Changes**: Certain ghosts cause drops in temperature; manage breathing to stay warm.
- **Ghost Sightings**: Encounter different ghost types with specific weaknesses:
  - **Ghost A**: Strengthens with prayers; avoid eye contact or look away.
  - **Ghost B**: Weakens with prayers; use prayer to repel.
  - **Ghost C**: SOON.
  - **Ghost D**: SOON.
- **Environmental Changes**: Objects move or float unexpectedly; reset them using eye movements.

### Endings

Choose your path wisely:

- **Good Ending**: Maintain sanity above zero until morning (Subuh prayer time).
  - The game concludes with the sound of parents entering the room.
  - Parents wake up the child, prompting them to perform Subuh prayer.
- **Bad Ending**: Sanity drops to zero, triggering a final, overwhelming supernatural event.
  - The screen fades to black as the player is shown being possessed by malevolent forces.
